## Requirements and compatibility

Crystal 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9.

## New features

### Multi table inheritance

It is now possible to define models that inherit from other concrete models (ie. non-abstract models). In this situation, each model can be used/queried individually and has its own associated database. The framework automatically defines a set of "links" between each model that uses multi table inheritance and its parent models in order to ensure that the relational structure and inheritance hierarchy are maintained.

For example:

```crystal
class Person < Marten::Model
  field :id, :big_int, primary_key: true, auto: true
  field :first_name, :string, max_size: 100
  field :last_name, :string, max_size: 100
end

class Employee < Person
  field :company_name, :string, max_size: 100
end

employee = Employee.filter(first_name: "John").first!
employee.first_name # => "John"
```

All the fields defined in the `Person` model can be accessed when interacting with records of the `Employee` model (despite the fact that the data itself is stored in distinct tables).

You can read more about this new kind of model inheritance in [Multi table inheritance](../../models-and-databases/introduction#multi-table-inheritance).

### Schema handler callbacks

Handlers that inherit from the base schema handler - [`Marten::Handlers::Schema`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/Schema.html) - or one of its subclasses (such as [`Marten::Handlers::RecordCreate`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/RecordCreate.html) or [`Marten::Handlers::RecordUpdate`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/RecordUpdate.html)) can now define new kinds of callbacks that allow to easily manipulate the considered [schema](../../schemas/introduction) instance and to define logic to execute before the schema is validated or after (eg. when the schema validation is successful or failed):

* [`before_schema_validation`](../../handlers-and-http/callbacks#before_schema_validation)
* [`after_schema_validation`](../../handlers-and-http/callbacks#after_schema_validation)
* [`after_successful_schema_validation`](../../handlers-and-http/callbacks#after_successful_schema_validation)
* [`after_failed_schema_validation`](../../handlers-and-http/callbacks#after_failed_schema_validation)

For example, the [`after_successful_schema_validation`](../../handlers-and-http/callbacks#after_successful_schema_validation) callback can be used to create a flash message after a schema has been successfully validated:

```crystal
class ArticleCreateHandler < Marten::Handlers::Schema
  success_route_name "home"
  template_name "articles/create.html"
  schema ArticleSchema

  after_successful_schema_validation :generate_success_flash_message

  private def generate_success_flash_message : Nil
    flash[:notice] = "Article successfully created!"
  end
end
```

Please head over to [Schema handler callbacks](../../handlers-and-http/callbacks#schema-handler-callbacks) to learn more about these new types of callbacks.

### URL field for models and schemas

It is now possible to define `url` fields in [models](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#url) and [schemas](../../schemas/reference/fields#url). These allow you to easily persist valid URLs in your models but also to expect valid URL values in data validated through the use of schemas.

For example:

```crystal
class User < Marten::Model
  field :id, :big_int, primary_key: true, auto: true
  field :website_url, :url, blank: true, null: true
end
```

### Slug field for models and schemas

It is now possible to define `slug` fields in [models](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#slug) and [schemas](../../schemas/reference/fields#slug). These allow you to easily persist valid slug values (ie. strings that can only include characters, numbers, dashes, and underscores) in your models but also to expect such values in data validated through the use of schemas.

For example:

```crystal
class User < Marten::Model
  field :id, :big_int, primary_key: true, auto: true
  field :username, :slug
end
```

### Minor features

#### Models and databases

* Support for removing records from many-to-many fields was added and many-to-many field query sets now provide a [`#remove`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/DB/Query/ManyToManySet.html#remove(*objs%3AM)%3ANil-instance-method) helper method allowing to easily remove specific records from a specific relation. You can learn more about this capability in [Many-to-many relationships](../../models-and-databases/relationships#many-to-many-relationships).
* Support for clearing all the references to records targeted by many-to-many fields was added. Indeed, many-to-many field query sets now provide a [`#clear`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/DB/Query/ManyToManySet.html#clear%3ANil-instance-method) method allowing to easily clear a specific relation. You can learn more about this capability in [Many-to-many relationships](../../models-and-databases/relationships#many-to-many-relationships).
* It is now possible to specify arrays of records to add or remove from a many-to-many relationship query set, through the use of the [`#add`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/DB/Query/ManyToManySet.html#add(*objs%3AM)-instance-method) and [`#remove`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/DB/Query/ManyToManySet.html#remove(*objs%3AM)%3ANil-instance-method) methods. See the [related documentation](../../models-and-databases/relationships#interacting-with-related-records-2) to learn more about interacting with records targeted by many-to-many relationships.
* Records targeted by reverse relations that are contributed to models by [`one_to_one`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#one_to_one) (ie. when using the [`related`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#related-2) option) are now memoized when the corresponding methods are called on related model instances.
* Relation fields that contribute methods that return query sets to models (such as [`many_to_one`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#many_to_one) or [`many_to_many`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#many_to_many) fields) now make sure that those query set objects are memoized at the record level. The corresponding instance variables are also reset when the considered records are reloaded. This allows to limit the number of queries involved when iterating multiple times over the records targeted by a [`many_to_many`](../../models-and-databases/reference/fields#many_to_many) field for example.

#### Handlers and HTTP

* It is now optional to define a name for included route maps (but defining a name for individual routes that are associated with [handlers](../../handlers-and-http/introduction) is still mandatory). You can read more about this in [Defining included routes](../../handlers-and-http/routing#defining-included-routes).
* The [`Marten::Handlers::Schema`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/Schema.html) generic handler now allows modifying the schema object context name through the use of the [`#schema_context_name`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/Handlers/Schema.html#schema_context_name(name%3AString|Symbol)-class-method) method.

#### Templates

* A [`with`](../../templates/reference/tags#with) template tag was introduced in order to make it easy to assign one or more variables inside a template block.
* A [`time`](../../templates/reference/filters#time) template tag was introduced in order to make it possible to output the string representation of a time variable according to a specific [time format pattern](https://crystal-lang.org/api/Time/Format.html).
* The ability to configure how undefined/unknown variables are treated was added to the framework: by default, such variables are treated as `nil` values (so nothing is displayed for such variables, and they are evaluated as falsey in if conditions). This behavior can be configured via the [`templates.strict_variables`](../../development/reference/settings#strict_variables) setting, and you can learn more about it in [Strict variables](../../templates/introduction#strict-variables).

#### Development

* The [`new`](../../development/reference/management-commands#new) management command now accepts an optional `--database` option that can be used to preconfigure the application database (eg. `--database=postgresql`).
* A [`clearsessions`](../../development/reference/management-commands#clearsessions) management command was introduced in order to ease the process of clearing expired session entries.
* Custom management commands can now define how they want to handle unknown or undefined arguments through the use of the [`#on_unknown_argument`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/CLI/Manage/Command/Base.html#on_unknown_argument(%26block%3AString->)-instance-method) method. This can be leveraged to implement management commands which can accept a variable number of positional arguments.
* Custom management commands can now define how they want to handle invalid options through the use of the [`#on_invalid_option`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/CLI/Manage/Command/Base.html#on_invalid_option(%26block%3AString->)-instance-method) method.

## Backward incompatible changes

### Handlers and HTTP

* Custom [session stores](../../handlers-and-http/sessions#session-stores) must now implement a [`#clear_expired_entries`](pathname:///api/dev/Marten/HTTP/Session/Store/Base.html#clear_expired_entries%3ANil-instance-method) method (allowing to clear expired session entries if this is applicable for the considered store).

### Templates

* The [`default`](../../templates/reference/filters.md#default) template filter will now return the specified default value if the incoming value is falsy or empty.
